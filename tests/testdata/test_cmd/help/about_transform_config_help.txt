A transform configuration file is used to describe which transformations and to
apply to a source CSV file. This configuration file a simple text file using
YAML format (the same format as an .ABOUT file).

The settings that can be defines in a configuration file are:

* column_renamings:
An optional map of source CSV column names to target CSV new column names that
is used to rename CSV columns.

For instance with this configuration the columns "Directory/Location" will be
renamed to "about_resource" and "foo" to "bar":

    column_renamings:
        'Directory/Location': about_resource
        foo: bar

The renaming is always applied first before other transforms and checks. All
other column names referenced below are these that exist AFTER the renamings
have been applied to the existing column names.


* kept_columns:
An optional list of column names that should be kept in the transformed CSV.

If this list is NOT provided, all the columns from the source CSV will be kept
(and added in generated .ABOUT files if the CSV is used for this later).

If this list is provided, only the listed columns are kept in the transformed
CSV and all other columns are removed.

For instance with this configuration the target CSV will only contains the "name"
and "version" columns and no other column:

    kept_columns:
        - name
        - version


* required_columns:
An optional list of required column names that must have a value, beyond the
standard required columns names (e.g. about_resource and about file_path for
the gen command).

If a source CSV does not have such a column or a row is missing a value for a
listed required column, an error is reported. This validation occurs after
processing the CVS for "kept_columns"

For instance with this configuration an error will be reported if the columns
"name" and "version" are missing or if any row does not have a value set for
these columns:

    required_columns:
        - name
        - version
